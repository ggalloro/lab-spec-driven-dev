# Functional Specification: Podcast Generator

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the functional requirements for the Podcast Generator application. Its purpose is to provide a clear understanding of the application's core features and user interactions, serving as a foundation for subsequent technical design and development.

## 2. Goal
The primary goal of the application is to enable users to easily generate personalized audio podcasts from the latest articles published in their preferred RSS feeds.

## 3. User Roles

### News Enthusiast
A user who wants to consume news content in an audio format, tailored to their interests, without having to manually read through articles.

## 4. Key Features

### 4.1 RSS Feed Management
*   **Add RSS Feed**: Users shall be able to input a valid RSS feed URL through the User Interface (UI). The application will validate the URL and add it to the user's list of preferred feeds.
*   **View/Manage Feeds**: Users shall be able to view a list of their currently added RSS feeds. For each feed, they should be able to see its title and URL.
*   **Remove RSS Feed**: Users shall be able to remove an RSS feed from their list of preferred feeds.

### 4.2 Podcast Generation
*   **Trigger Generation**: Users shall be able to initiate the generation of a new audio podcast from their selected RSS feeds via a dedicated UI action (e.g., a "Generate Podcast" button).
*   **Article Retrieval**: Upon triggering, the application will fetch the 3 articles that have not been previously fetched from all active RSS feeds.
*   **Article Summarization**: Each fetched article will be automatically summarized using an LLM to extract key information and present it concisely.
*   **Audio Synthesis**: The summarized content of the articles will be converted into natural-sounding speech, forming segments of the podcast.
*   **Podcast Compilation**: The individual audio segments will be compiled into a single audio file, representing the personalized news podcast. The podcast will have an initial greeting intro and final goodbye outro, this can be the same for all the podcasts or AI generated.

### 4.3 Podcast Playback and Download
*   **Podcast Listing**: Users shall be able to view a list of their generated podcasts, including creation date and duration.
*   **Playback**: Users shall be able to play the generated audio podcasts directly within the application's UI.
*   **Download**: Users shall be able to download the generated audio podcast file to their local device.

### 4.4 User Interface
*   **Hero Image**: The main application page shall display a high quality hero image featuring a robot agent reading the news in a TV studio.

## 5. Non-Functional Considerations
*   **Usability**: The UI should be intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to effortlessly manage feeds and generate podcasts.
*   **Responsiveness**: The application should provide timely feedback to the user, especially during podcast generation, to indicate progress or completion.

## 6. Data Storage Considerations
*   **RSS Feed URLs**: The application will store the RSS feed URLs provided by the user only for the current session, RSS feed URLs will not be persistently stored.
*   **Generated Audio Files**: Generated podcast audio files will primarily be stored locally on the server where the application is hosted. Cloud storage for audio files is an optional future consideration.
*   **Article Summaries**: Summaries may be stored temporarily during the podcast generation process.
